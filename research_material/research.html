We have studied the fundamental mechanics of rotational stability of
multi-body systems with the goal to identify a general
balance and stability criterion for humanoid robots.  
For this, our research focuses on the rate of change of centroidal angular 
momentum of a robot, which is the aggregate angular momentum computed
at the robot's CoM.  We propose	humanoid robot balance control 
approaches using angular momentum rate change.

Centroidal moment pivot (CMP) is the point on the foot/ground surface of a 
robot where the total ground reaction force <i>would have to act </i> such 
that its centroidal angular moementum stays constant. This new 
criterion generalizes earlier concepts such as GCoM, CoP, ZMP, and FRI point, 
and extends their applicability.

<font ,="" size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,geneva">If you could reduce the instantaneous inertia of the entire humanoid 
robot to that of a single rigid body, what would it be? 
<br><br>
Simple models of complex dynamic systems are often instrumental in 
our understaning of their essential behavior. Such models must 
possess simplicity and compactness while not over-simplifying
the system.
<br><br>
The linear inverted pendulum model and a number of its variations
are frequently used in the gait and balance study of human 
and humanoid robots. By focusing attentionto the fundamental 
aspects of humanoid dynamics, such models open the way to new 
classes of control laws, which would otherwise be difficult 
or impossible to conceive.
<br><br>
While useful in their own right, a limitation of the above models is
that they represent the entire humanoid body only as a point mass
and do not characterize the significant centroidal moment of inertia
of the humanoid body. The centroidal moment
of inertia is a property of the distributed masses of the robot
limbs (head, arms, legs, etc) away from the CoM.
<br><br>
We study the Reaction Mass Pendulum (RMP), a reduced model version of the
complete humanoid robot. This model compactly captures the centroidal angular
momentum of the humanoid robot as a spinning ellipsoid which continuously
changes its shape, size and orientation.

<font ,="" size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,geneva">Use of Capture Point (CaP) and angular momentum in biped robot push recovery. 
<br><br>
Push recovery is important for humanoid robots operating in human
environments. No matter how well we attempt to shield these robots,
it is inevitable that they will occasionally bump into objects and
other people, and will be tripped up by objects
that go undetected. Therefore, their ultimate utility will depend on
good algorithms for push recovery and disturbance rejection.
</font></p><p>
<font ,="" size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,geneva">Push recovery is difficult
because humanoid dynamics are high dimensional, non-linear,
and hybrid. Moreover, a humanoid robot is underactuated and makes
friction-limited unilateral contacts with the ground. Despite these
theoretical difficulties, animals and humans are very adept at push
recovery.  Although the
humanoid literature contains several analysis and control techniques
for external disturbance rejection, there is yet to emerge a 
principled approach
towards ``when and where to step'' under a force disturbance.

</font><p>
<font ,="" size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,geneva">We propose a novel control method for lower-limb assist that produces a virtual modification
of the mechanical impedance of the human limbs. This effect is accomplished by 
making the exoskeleton display active impedance properties. Active impedance control
emphasizes control of the exoskeleton's dynamics and regulation of the transfer of energy 
between the exoskeleton and the user. It's goal is improving the dynamic response of the 
human limbs without sacrificing the user's control authority. The proposed method
is an alternative to myoelectrical exoskeleton control, which is based on estimating muscle
torques from electromyographical(EMG) activity. Implementation of an EMG-based controller
is a complex task that involves modeling the user's musculoskeletal system and requires recalibration.
In contrast, active impedance control is less dependent on estimation of the user's attempted 
motion, thereby avoiding conflicts resulting from inaccurate estimation. 
</font></p><p>
<font ,="" size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,geneva">We also introduce
a new form of human assist based on improving the kinematic response of the limbs.
Reduction of average muscle torques is a common goal of research in human assist.
However, less emphasis has been placed so far on improving the user's agility of motion.
We aim to use active impedance control to attain such effects as increasing the user's average
speed of motion, and improving their acceleration capabilities in order to compensate for perturbations
from the environment.
